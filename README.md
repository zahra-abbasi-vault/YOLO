# Crop using YOLOv8

I had a task which was to train a AI model to classify different types of coffee beans, but my dataset included images contaning multiple coffee beans, which was not suitable for training a classification model.

So I had to detect and crop each coffee bean from the images.
for this perpous I fine tuned YOLOv8 model and used it to detect the coffee beans and crop them.
